## 0.4.1 ‚Äî 2020-11-25

### üõ† Breaking changes

- This version adds an internal database migration, which means that when a user's device upgrades from an app with `expo-updates@0.3.x` to an app with `expo-updates@0.4.x`, any updates they had previously downloaded will no longer be accessible.
  -   For **managed workflow apps**, this is inconsequential as this upgrade will be part of a major SDK version upgrade. You do not need to do anything if your app is made using the managed workflow.
  -   For **bare workflow apps**, this means updates downloaded on clients running `expo-updates@0.3.x` will need to be redownloaded in order to run after those clients are upgraded to `expo-updates@0.4.x`. We recommend incrementing your runtime/SDK version after updating to `expo-updates@0.4.x`, and republishing any OTA updates that you do not intend to distribute embedded in your application binary.

## 0.4.0 ‚Äî 2020-11-17

### üêõ Bug fixes

- Fixed issue in **managed workflow** where `reloadAsync` doesn't reload the app if called immediately after the app starts. ([#10917](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10917) and [#10918](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/10918) by [@esamelson](https://github.com/esamelson))
