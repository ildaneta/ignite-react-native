<!-- ## Config with package.json

You can configure the iOS and Android linking using the `react-native-unimodules` object in the `package.json`:

```json
{
  "react-native-unimodules": {
    "android": {
      "exclude": [
        // Prevent a module from being included on Android
        "expo-camera"
      ]
    },
    "ios": {
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

`package.json` config is an experimental feature used to support monorepo managed workflow EAS build projects that need to reliably generate iOS and Android code from scratch. The `react-native-unimodules` object name is subject to change in the future. -->
