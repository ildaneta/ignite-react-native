# expo-structured-headers

Java and Objective-C (partial) implementations of https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc8941.html.

The Objective-C implementation only includes the parsing component and does not include serialization. It also ignores ordering of dictionaries.

The Java implementation is a derivative of https://github.com/reschke/structured-fields, modified for Android API level 21 compatibility and with the package name in each source file changed.
